The form is attached, it did not look like an on-line HTML/JAVA form,
right?

Guidelines for Documenting Data Sets: DATA SET INFORMATION

The purpose of this page is to provide detailed information on a particular
data set to enable other researchers to use the data for a variety of analysis 
tasks. For example, a data page might describe census data which could then be
used for different analysis tasks such as classification or clustering.

When filling out this form, simply place your answer after the point indicated
by '>'. We will then process the form to ensure that all documentation files 
follow a common format.


1. Title of Data Set
   -- Indicate the central topic of the domain.
>  Movies

2. Data Type
   -- Indicate the type of data: multivariate, relational, time seris, 
      sequential, images, spatial, text, time series, transactional, web data
   -- If the data is heterogenous, list all relevant types.
   Relational, with multi-valued fields and time-values.  Suitable for 
   objectification and inferencing novel and social relationships.  
   A Remakes file is suitable for testing recursive processing. 

3. Abstract
   A MAIN file listing over 10 000 films; with many older, odd, and 
   cult films.
   Ancilliary files, useful for joining and inferencing on CASTS, 
   ACTORS, PEOPLE, as directors and some producers etc, REMAKES, 
   and some data on STUDIOS.  Detailed descriptions of the fields 
   and their formats is provided in a DOC file.  The material 
   includes some social information, as `lived-with'  and `married to'. 

4. Sources

5. Data Characteristics
   The original motivation was for database class exercises, to replace
   the boring `manager of the toy-department' queries.  Note that the
   CASTS, refering MAIN and ACTORS is logically identical to the 
   inventory file refering to suppliers and assemblies in the the
   standard bill-of-materials problems.
   Personal interests caused to be made complete for all Hitchcock 
   movies and TV episodes.  Related films by type and actor were
   added gradually.

   Subsequent research on temporal databases caused date fields (years
   only) to be added.  It allows testing, say,if the dates-of-work
   of an ACTOR match the dates of the MAIN films that the CAST relation
   shiows.  Object-oriented database features could be tested with
   fields having multiple and two-level values, as documented in DOC.

   The entries were gradually collected during course work starting 
   about 1975 and are still being updated.  Most of the entries were 
   manual.  The DOC file lists some of the reference works used.
   Corrections and additions continue to be appreciated.

   All Types:
     (a) Missing Values:
         -- Outside of key fields, missing values are common. Their
            encoding is described in DOC.  Sometimes the data seems
            to be unavailable, sometimes it hasn't been entered.
            Some information, as `lived-with' is inherently incomplete.

     (b) Censored data: Minor actors are ignored.

     (c) Cost Information: (if applicable/available)
         -- none

     (d) Dependencies: yes, documented in detail in DOC.
         Every MAIN film must have a director in PEOPLE.  
         About 50 pseudo director names ahve been listed in PEOPLE 
         to allow interesting films to with (yet) unknown directors 
         to be entered.
         Every CASTS entry must relate to a MAIN film entry.
         Every ACTOR should appear in some CASTS entry, but not vv.

      See DOC for more type information.

   Text:
     (a) language: Films are listed, if known, with their original
         language title. an Alt(T: ) field provides English translations,
         where known.
     (c) structured: the files are structured in multiple HTML tables, 
         and can be directly displayed by capable browsers.  The CASTS 
         file brings many browsers to their knees.

   Image: some images of actors exist, but are not included because of
         copyright protection.

6. Other Relevant Information

7. Data Format
   The current files are in HTML, to allow easy parsing to other
   formats. An XML version is being considered.

   The approximate file sizes are
   DOC .......    50K 
   MAIN ...... 1 145K   11 400 entries
   PEOPLE ....   355K    3 290 entries
   CASTS ..... 4 340K   46 000 entries
   ACTORS ....   811K    6 800 entries
   REMAKES ...   135K    1 278 entries
   STUDIOS ...    26K      200 entries

8. Past Usage
    Class exercises, research test cases.
    Has included other universities, and some database companies.
